# text_modifier_python


Normally our support engineers count letters manually and put `<br>` after specific number of letters. <br>
So I have developed this splitter to reduce their manual work.<br>
Input: Maximum no of letters between two `<br>` and an excel file.<br>
Output: Convert first column of the excel file and put `<br>` after or before the maximum no(Input) on every row. and generate excel output.
